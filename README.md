# Social-Network-Analyser
Method of examining a Social Network
You are given dataset (data.json) representing a group of people, in the form of a social graph. 
Each person listed has one or more connections to the group.
Choose a person within the group stored in the database.
The app will then display the following information:

- Direct friends: those people who are directly connected to the chosen user;
- Friends of friends: those who are two steps away from the chosen user but not directly connected to the chosen user;
- Suggested friends: people in the group who know 2 or more direct friends of the chosen user 
  but are not directly connected to the chosen user;
